When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you anticipate using multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository? 

To ensure that only logical commits are added to the repository.

What are the differences between forks, clones, and branches?

Forks are copies of another repository on github. Clones are full copies of repositories. Forks are a type of clone done on github servers. Branches contain commit histories. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? 

In case you can't access it. So you know what the last version pushed to gitHub was.
